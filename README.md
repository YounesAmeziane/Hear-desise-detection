## THIS IS A HEART DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM THAT ESTIMATES WHETHER A      ##
## PATIENT HAS HEART DISEASE BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSIS OF 303     ##
## CASES.                                                                  ##

## THE MODEL USED IS LOGISTIC REGRESSION.                                  ##
##                                                                         ##
## THE TRAINING ACCURACY SCORE IS 85.12%, AND THE TESTING ACCURACY SCORE   ##
## IS 81.97%, WHICH IS CONSIDERED GOOD FOR A SMALL DATASET LIKE THIS ONE.  ##
## IN GENERAL, ACCURACY ABOVE 75% IS A SOLID RESULT IN THIS CONTEXT.       ##
##                                                                         ##
